How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

When programming it is important to remember not just that you need to meet the requirments for the project, but that someone had to use that program. So it is always important to consider what the user is going to need and make sure it is as easy to use as possible for tyhem, becasue if they are happy then the product owner is happy, and if the product owner is happy, you are happy. Creating user stories helps with this by ensuring you think about the problem from the users point of veiwq and see what they are actually thinking.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I typically approach developing programs by first determining what I need to do then planning out what steps i need to take to get there. Only after i havce a clear plan in place and I have concidered how the different parts are going to interact do i start actually coding. I hope to incoperate the concept of adaptibility into my futer development work, even when not working using the agile method I beleive that there are many ways to structure your code so that it is easier to change and adapt if you need to.
